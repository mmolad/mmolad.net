						Since 2007, I've been a member of the technology industry, learning and working with websites, games, and computers.  With a career that started at <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong>, a premier developer and publisher of entertainment software, I began to learn and grow and discover my skills and talent.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an <strong>Internal Information Specialist</strong>, my roles were varied: from Customer Service and Quality Assurance to Social Media, Web Design, and Training. With a focus on knowledge management and communications, I set the bar for our Customer Support personnel and helped developed tools used by our teams worldwide.

						After 6 years at Blizzard Entertainment (with a <a href="http://blizzard.com/company/about/service-awards.html">cool sword</a> to show for it), I moved back to my hometown in Houston, Texas to work for <strong>PerSys Medical</strong>, a medical device company that helps save lives around the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						As <strong>Business Technology Manager</strong>, I am responsible for most technical issues within the company, including digital marketing, website creation and administration, as well as  computer services and telephony systems. In my free time I continue to play games and be a part of the video game community.

	<h2>Work History</h2>
	<p>I've worked on various web features throughout the years, mostly internal items while working at <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong>.  Learning to code for the web on platforms such as MediaWiki, SharePoint, and Drupal, I began to specialize in working with systems with limited control over the structure of the page.  While I've done various full-stack web development, my heart lies in CSS and wrestling the web to do what you and your designers had in mind. </p>
	<p>My playground is <strong>Reddit</strong>, where subreddit creators can control the appearance of their subreddit, but have no ability to script or create complex HTML content. With clever solutions and a firm grasp of CSS, I've helped various subreddit creators and moderators get their site looking exactly as they want.  You can find me on the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/csshelp">/r/csshelp</a> subreddit, helping others with their work, and on my own subreddit, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/overwatch">/r/Overwatch</a>.</p>

		<p>As an Internal Information Specialist at <a href="http://blizzard.com">Blizzard Entertainment</a>, I had a broad range of duties and responsibilities within the Customer Service department.  With an evolving role within Customer Service, my team was the center of knowledge management and policy guidelines for the United States, with global teams following in suit. </p>
		<p>Starting as a Game Master, I shortly moved to assist with any gameplay reports submitted by players to our customer service team. As our team's responsibilities evolved and grew, I become the focal point for customer service generated reports and become a liaison for any intersection between development and customer service issues.</p>
		<p>With an ever-growing user-base and additional titles that fell under our team's responsibility, I helped deploy multiple learning solutions and content management systems for our customer service agents. Our team migrated from wiki, to SharePoint, Drupal, and other proprietary systems. As our focus moved towards helping educate on self-service solutions and contact prevention, I worked on our <a href="http://blizzard.com/support/">knowledge center</a> and social media sites, posting content as needed and representing customer service as a "blue poster".</p>
		<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to assist our Web Team during <a href="http://blizzcon.com">BlizzCon</a> preparations, earning a temporary assignment in Irvine, California. I served as producer on several projects including the reveal website for Mists of Pandaria, the newest expansion for World of Warcraft. </p>

I was selected to design and manage the subreddit's appearance and technical functionality, and help manage ongoing efforts such as event coordination, policy review, and moderation as needed.

			Since 2007, I've been a member of the technology industry, learning and working with websites, games, and computers.  With a career that started at <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong>, a premier developer and publisher of entertainment software, I began to learn and grow and discover my skills and talent.

		<p>
			As an <strong>Internal Information Specialist</strong>, my roles were varied: from Customer Service and Quality Assurance to Social Media, Web Design, and Training. With a focus on knowledge management and communications, I set the bar for our Customer Support personnel and helped developed tools used by our teams worldwide.

			After 6 years at Blizzard Entertainment (with a <a href="http://blizzard.com/company/about/service-awards.html">cool sword</a> to show for it), I moved back to my hometown in Houston, Texas to work for <strong>PerSys Medical</strong>, a medical device company that helps save lives around the world. As <strong>Business Technology Manager</strong>, I was in charge of global IT planning as well as regional issues and deployment, I helped identify growing pains for a small business in a booming industry. While there, I managed a small team, revamped our marketing tools and strategy, and modernized aging technology and practices.

			I later joined <strong>cPanel</strong> as a <strong>Community Manager</strong>, part of their core Product Development team. Our team managed feedback for new and existing features, revamped our yearly company conference, and built new pipelines for internal feedback and employee discussion.

			As a current freelance community specialist, I'm working on a few web development projects, helping mantain the communities I'm a part of, and still playing the latest games.
